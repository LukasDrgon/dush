You might also be interested in [mitt][] - a 200 bytes event emitter. It has strict policy 
to stay exactly below 200b with no compromises, so has lack of support
for few things and that's why `dush` exists.

## Highlights

- **Microscopic:** Around ~350 bytes gzip + minify, including the UMD wrapper.
- **Functional:** Methods don't rely on `this` context.
- **Compatibility:** Almost like Node's EventEmitter.
- **Compliant:** Can `.emit` events with multiple params.
- **Chaining:** Support all methods to be chainable.
- **Useful:** A wildcard `'*'` event type listens to all events.
- **Friendly:** Plays well with [browserify][], [webpack][] and browser users.
- **Bundled:** Available as ES6 Module, CommonJS, UMD.
- **Clean:** Does not mess with DOM or anything.

## Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```
$ npm install dush --save
```

or install using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```
$ yarn add dush
```

## API

### [dush](src/index.js#L32)
> A constructor function that returns an object with a few methods.

* `returns` **{Object}**: methods  

**Example**

```js
const dush = require('dush')
const emitter = dush()

console.log(emitter.all) // => {}
console.log(emitter.on) // => Function
console.log(emitter.once) // => Function
console.log(emitter.off) // => Function
console.log(emitter.emit) // => Function
```

### [.on](src/index.js#L81)
> Add `handler` for `name` event.

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: Type of event to listen for, or `'*'` for all events    
* `handler` **{String}**: Function to call in response to given event    
* `returns` **{Object}**: The `dush` instance for chaining  

**Example**

```js
emitter
  .on('hi', (place) => {
    console.log('hello', place) // => 'hello world'
  })
  .on('hi', (place) => {
    console.log('hello', place) // => 'hello world'
  })

emitter.emit('hi', 'world')
```

### [.once](src/index.js#L117)
> Add `handler` for `name` event that will be called only one time

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: Type of event to listen for, or `'*'` for all events    
* `handler` **{String}**: Function to call in response to given event    
* `returns` **{Object}**: The `dush` instance for chaining  

**Example**

```js
const called = 0

emitter.once('foo', () => {
  console.log('called only once')
  called++
})

emitter
  .emit('foo')
  .emit('foo')
  .emit('foo')

console.log(called) // => 1
```

### [.off](src/index.js#L157)
> Remove `handler` for `name` event. If `handler` not passed will remove **all** listeners for that `name` event.

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: Type of event to listen for, or `'*'` for all events    
* `handler` **{String}**: Function to call in response to given event    
* `returns` **{Object}**: The `dush` instance for chaining  

**Example**

```js
const handler = () => {
  console.log('not called')
}

emitter
  .on('foo', handler)
  .on('foo', (abc) => {
    console.log('called', abc) // => 'called 123'
  })
  .off('foo', handler)
  .emit('foo', 123)

// or removing all listeners of `foo`
emitter.off('foo')
emitter.emit('foo')
```

### [.emit](src/index.js#L196)
> Invoke all handlers for given `name` event. If present, `'*'` listeners are invoked too with `(type, ...rest)` signature, where the `type` argument is a string representing the name of the called event; and all of the rest arguments

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: The name of the event to invoke    
* `args` **{any}**: Any number of arguments of any type of value, passed to each listener    
* `returns` **{Object}**: The `dush` instance for chaining  

**Example**

```js
emitter.on('*', (name, a, b, c) => {
  console.log('name is', name)
  console.log('rest args', a, b, c)
})

emitter.on('foo', (a, b, c) => {
  console.log(a, b, c) // => 1 2  3
})

emitter.emit('foo', 1, 2, 3)
emitter.emit('bar', 555)
```

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/dush/issues/new).  
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
